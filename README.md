# Orbituary
Orbituary is a minimalistic orbiting Game created by Gideon Fox in processing java.
The game features simple shape-based graphics, a greyscale color scheme, and a haunting mystical soundtrack.
The goal of Orbituary is to lead a dot to the center of the screen, while gaining points and avoiding collisions with other dots.
Occasionally power-ups will appear, and once collected, will grant the player certain abilities or have an effect on other dots.
See how far you can make it, and please, enjoy the game!
